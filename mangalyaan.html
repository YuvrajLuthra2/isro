    <h1>Mars Orbiter Mission</h1>
    <br>
    <p>"Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), India's first interplanetary mission to planet Mars was launchedonboard PSLV-C25 on November 05, 2013. ISRO has become the fourth space agency to successfully send a spacecraft to Mars orbit.Though the designed mission life is 6 months, MOM completed 7 years in its orbit on Sept 24, 2021.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Mission objective</h1>
    <br>
  <p>The objectives of this mission are primarily technological and include design, realization and launch of a Mars Orbiter spacecraft capable of operating with sufficient autonomy during the journey phase; Mars orbit insertion / capture and in-orbit phase around Mars. MOM carries five scientific payloads to study the Martian surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere.
  </p>
   <br>
    <p>Mars continues to be an object of keen interest to scientists in the context of planetary evolution and extra-terrestrial life. Based on our understanding of Mars, which was thought to be probably a warm and wet planet earlier, is now seen to be dry with a thin atmosphere. How this evolution has taken place is still a topic of research. In this backdrop, the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission carried the following five scientific payloads:</p>
    
  <br>

    <ol style="color: aliceblue;">
      <li>Mars Color Camera (MCC)</li>
      <li>Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS)</li>
      <li>Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM)</li>
      <li> Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA)</li>
      <li>Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP)  "ISRO</li>
    </ol>

      <br>
      <p>India’s space research organization has succeeded in sending a rover to Mars in the first attempt. This mission was conducted and successful in the budget of 4.5 billion rupees ($74m) which is fairly cheaper compared to other space organizations. The American Maven orbiter cost 10 times more than the Mars orbiter created by ISRO.
        Even Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Stated that ISRO’s real-life martian mission cost less money than Gravity film that was produced by Hollywood.Even Bollywood sci-fi movies like Ra.One cost a good chunk of what it has taken to get Mangalyaan to Mars. India’s Mars orbiter budget is $74m , and Nasa's Maven Mars mission costs $671m. Only the US, Russia and Europe have been able to sent missions to Mars
